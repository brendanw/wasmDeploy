<h3>BaseBeta Mobile Privacy Policy</h3>
We collected the device UUID and share it with a company called Fabric. We allow Fabric to use your device UUID
for the limited purposes of providing us, BaseBeta, diagnostic information about your device and account for Fabric's
product Crashlytics. We use Crashlytics to better understand crashes and irregularities of the BaseBeta mobile apps.
The diagnostic information provided by Crashlytics helps us improve the app experience and ensure there are no crashes.
We also provide the device UUID to a company called Amplitude which provides us software to help understand how users
are navigating throughout the app. This is the only way in which we use the device UUID.
